REQUIREMENTS

You will need the following libraries and header files installed on
your system to get RATTLE compiled from source.

	libconfig version 1.4.5 or newer;
	pkg-config


BUILDING FROM A RELEASE

Use the configure script to generate the required Makefiles, then make.

$ ./configure
$ make

To install, give an install rule to make. That is, as root;

$ su -c `make install`

or

$ sudo make install


BUILDING FROM TREE

If you cannot find the configure script, you need to run autogen first.

$ build/autogen

Note that you need the GNU autotools to generate the script.
