RATTLE, A VPN manager.

RATTLE stands for (r)emote (a)ccess (t)hrough (t)tunnel.
The remaining part of the accronym is left to the individual for kind wording
once they get to know better.  As an example, mine are (l)ove, (e)tcetera.

RATTLE is not ready and most likely not going to be for a couple of years.
However, it could be months if you join the fun!

RATTLE is inspired by the DNDS software.
